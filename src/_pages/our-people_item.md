Camille McDonald is a Senior Associate in our family law team.

She graduated from the University of Adelaide in 2008 with a double degree in Law and International Studies and was admitted to practice the same year. In 2015 she achieved a Masters Degree in Applied Family Law.

With a passion for law and justice, teamed with her love of people, Camille chose to pursue law because she wanted her career to involve interaction with people and complex problem solving.

She grew up in the western suburbs of Adelaide and that’s where she lives today. Camille is a wife and mum to her three young daughters, therefore, family life, with all its ups and downs, is something she understands well.

Working in our Port Adelaide office, Camille truly understands the particular issues affecting people in her part of the world. Every client she meets needs quality advice and advocacy as well as affordability.

With significant experience handling both large and modest asset pools, Camille’s experience is that, negotiation and searching for out-of-court settlements benefit all concerned.

Camille understands that issues involving children can be highly complex and emotional, and therefore, focuses her energies on the maintenance of strong and sincere rapport with her clients. As well as achieving a just outcome, Camille’s aim is for her clients to endure as little emotional trauma as possible.
